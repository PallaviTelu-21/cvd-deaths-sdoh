# Socioeconomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Mortality in Indiana 


Project Overview

This project investigates how social determinants of health (SDoH) influence cardiovascular mortality in Indiana. Using zip-code-level data from 2015 to 2022, we analyze factors such as income, education, racial disparities, healthcare access, and environmental resources to identify high-risk populations and enable data-driven public health interventions.

Data Sources :

U.S. Census Bureau: Employment, income, and demographic data.
Overpass API: Healthcare facilities, food options, and fitness centers.
Zillow: Housing quality data.
Indiana State Department of Health: Cardiovascular mortality rates.


Statistical Analysis: Spearmanâ€™s correlation and Kruskal-Wallis tests to identify key SDoH factors affecting mortality.

Predictive Modeling: Evaluated and compared:
Random Forest
XGBoost
FastAI Tabular
Explainability: Used SHAP to understand feature importance, identifying key predictors such as education levels, income, and racial disparities.
